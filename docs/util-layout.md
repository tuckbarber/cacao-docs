## Available classes

* `u-cf`: Applies a clearfix to prevent an element that contains float elements from collapsing.
* `uFloatLeft`: Float an element to the left.
* `uFloatRight`: Float an element to the right.
* `u-nbfc`: Adds a 'new block formatting context', won't let element wrap under floats and
contains all floated children. Will clip overflowing content.
* `u-nbfcAlt`: An alternative to `u-nbfc` that avoids clipping overflow content.
